MiniBusBoard Project

An ESP32 project I built to display live arrivals 
for any bus stop in Seattle, but it also works for any 
of the following transit regions.

New York, NY
Puget Sound, WA
Rogue Valley Transportation District, Oregon
San Diego Metropolitan Transit System, California
Washington, D.C.
Pozna≈Ñ region, Poland
Buenos Aires, Argentina
Spokane, WA

I have uploaded ESP32 + AWS Lambda code.
I have also attached a JSON file for pin configurations.
