## MiniBusBoard Project

An ESP32 project I built to display live arrivals 
for any bus stop in Seattle, but it also works for any 
of the following transit regions.

 - New York, NY
 - Puget Sound, WA
 - Rogue Valley Transportation District, Oregon
 - San Diego Metropolitan Transit System, California
 - Washington, D.C.
 - PoznaÅ„ region, Poland
 - Buenos Aires, Argentina
 - Spokane, WA

### Lambda-mmb:
This is the code I used in my Lambda function. To interact with it, you will need to set up a trigger.
A layer is also needed to properly use this function. Lambda free tier includes > 400,000 requests per month.

### ESP32:
This is the code I used in my ESP32 microcontroller. You will need to write in your WiFi SSID and password,
as well as include your own API call to whatever API gateway you make. 

### OledTest:
This is test code for working with your OLED display. I used an SSD1306-based display which had a funky bitmap
output, but you can use this site to change your bitmap format (https://en.radzio.dxp.pl/bitmap_converter/).
Additionally, you may find an issue if your SSD1306 displays have the same address. Most models can have their
addresses changed by resoldering a resistor on the backside. I did not find a software workaround.

### pin_config:
This is a JSON file that outlines which GPIO pins I used for each component. For an ESP32 pin diagram, you 
can visit https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/
